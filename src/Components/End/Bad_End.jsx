      <p>
        The once clear lines between reality and delusion blur, twisting into a
        nightmarish tapestry woven from your own fears and regrets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each step you take echoes with the haunting reminders of paths not
        taken, of choices that led you deeper into the abyss.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world around you warps and shifts, a reflection of your unraveling
        mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, it is not the darkness that claims you, but the madness born
        from your own actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are left alone, a prisoner of your own making, trapped in an endless
        cycle of torment and despair.
