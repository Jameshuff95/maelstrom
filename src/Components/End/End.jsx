  // Good Ending
  // As the final echoes of your footsteps fade into the light, the walls of reality solidify around you. The whispers that once haunted your mind are silenced, replaced by a serene clarity that washes over you.

  // Each choice you made, each path you took, has led you hereâ€”to a place where the shadows of doubt and fear no longer hold sway. The world around you brightens, a reflection of your newfound peace and strength.

  //In the end, it is not the darkness that defines you, but the light born from your courage and wisdom. You are no longer alone, but embraced by the harmony of your own making, free from the chains of your past.

      <p>
        The once clear lines between reality and delusion blur, twisting into a
        nightmarish tapestry woven from your own fears and regrets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each step you take echoes with the haunting reminders of paths not
        taken, of choices that led you deeper into the abyss.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world around you warps and shifts, a reflection of your unraveling
        mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, it is not the darkness that claims you, but the madness born
        from your own actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are left alone, a prisoner of your own making, trapped in an endless
        cycle of torment and despair.
